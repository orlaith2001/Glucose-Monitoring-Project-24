The data analysis was performed on the study "CGM Intervention in Teens and Young Adults with Type 1 Diabetes"

This study was done as although there is now a wide use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) among diabetics compared to blood glucose monitoring (BGM), BGM is still the prevalent form of measurement among teens and young adults. This study aims to implement CGM more into the younger population and the data analysis has been carried out to see if there is a benefit to CGM over BGM.

All datasets relevant to the analysis can be found in the dataset folder. The final presentation and python code can be found in their named folders respectfully. Also present in these folders are additional folders named archive. Here can be found past versions of the presentations and code, showing the development of the project over time.
